# Hand-Tracking
That sounds like an impressive project to include on your resume! Here's a concise way to describe it:

### Project: Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse
**Technologies Used:** Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, PyAutoGUI

**Description:**
Developed an innovative system for controlling the mouse cursor using hand gestures captured via a webcam. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to provide a hands-free method of interacting with a computer.

**Key Features:**
- **Hand Tracking:** Utilized Mediapipe's hand tracking solution to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
- **Cursor Movement:** Mapped the coordinates of the index finger tip to control the mouse cursor on the screen using PyAutoGUI.
- **Click Detection:** Implemented a feature to detect finger pinches (thumb and index finger) to simulate mouse clicks.
- **Real-Time Performance:** Ensured smooth and responsive cursor movements with real-time hand gesture recognition.

**Project Highlights:**
- Achieved seamless integration of hand gesture recognition with system-level mouse control.
- Developed a robust algorithm to differentiate between cursor movement and click gestures.
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility and tested the system on different screen resolutions.

**Technical Challenges:**
- Optimized hand tracking performance to minimize latency and ensure real-time response.
- Dealt with variations in hand positioning and lighting conditions to maintain accuracy.
- Mapped hand coordinates from the camera feed to screen coordinates accurately across different resolutions.

**Outcome:**
- Successfully demonstrated the application of computer vision in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
- Enhanced the user experience by providing an alternative to traditional mouse usage, potentially benefiting users with limited mobility.
